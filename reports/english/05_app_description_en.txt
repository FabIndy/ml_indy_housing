# Step 5 — Application Overview: Indy House Price Predictor

This report introduces the **public web application** developed as part of the **ML Indy Housing** project.
It allows users to **estimate the selling price of a house** in the Indianapolis area using a model deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

**Live demo:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/FabIndy/house-price-ui

## 1. Purpose of the Application

The application provides an **interactive interface** where users can enter the main characteristics of a property to instantly obtain a **predicted price in USD**.
It is powered by the **final XGBoost model** trained during this project (`19-XGBoost-pseudohuber-fineweighting.ipynb`), which achieved a **mean absolute error (MAE) of $45,195** for standard houses and a **relative error rate of 12.8%** — demonstrating strong reliability for the vast majority of the market (< $1M).

## 2. ZIP Codes Covered

Predictions are available **only for the ZIP codes included in the trained dataset**.
These ZIP codes correspond to the main residential areas of Indianapolis and its suburbs:

 46201. 46202. 46203. 46204. 46205. 46208. 46214. 46216. 46217.
 46218. 46219. 46220. 46221. 46222. 46224. 46225. 46226. 46227. 46228.
 46229. 46231. 46234. 46235. 46236. 46237. 46239. 46240. 46241. 46250.
 46254. 46256. 46259. 46260. 46268. 46278. 46280. 46290. 46032. 46033.
 46074. 46037. 46038. 46077. 46112. 46123. 46168. 46142. 46143. 46060.
 46062. 46075. 46055. 46107.

If a user enters a ZIP code outside this list, the model may not produce a valid or reliable prediction.

## 3. Inputs Required

The app collects the following features before sending them to the backend API (`/predict` endpoint):

| Field                  | Description                           | Example |
|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------|:--------|
| **Bedrooms**           | Number of bedrooms                    | 3       |
| **Bathrooms**          | Number of bathrooms                   | 2       |
| **Latitude**           | Geographic coordinate (°)             | 39.90   |
| **Longitude**          | Geographic coordinate (°)             | -86.15  |
| **Living Area (sqft)** | Total interior surface in square feet | 2,000   |
| **House Age (years)**  | Age of the house                      | 10      |
| **Zipcode**            | 5-digit ZIP code (see list above)     | 46220   |

**Note:**
Latitude and longitude can be easily retrieved from the property’s address using **Google Maps** (right-click → *What’s here?*).
These coordinates are crucial because the model uses them to **calculate the distance from downtown Indianapolis**, a key feature influencing housing prices.

## 4. System Architecture

The prediction pipeline relies on three components deployed on Hugging Face:

1. **Model container** – hosts the trained XGBoost model.
2. **FastAPI backend** – receives JSON input and returns predictions via REST API.
3. **Gradio frontend** – provides the interactive user interface accessible online.

Communication between containers follows this structure:

[Gradio UI] ⇄ [FastAPI Backend] ⇄ [XGBoost Model]

Each request entered through the interface is sent to the API, which calls the model and returns the estimated price.

## 5. Model Reliability

The deployed model demonstrates:
- **High accuracy** on standard houses (< $1M): MAE = $45,195 → relative error = **12.8%**.
- **Acceptable stability** on luxury houses (≥ $1M): MAE = $531,241 → relative error = 29.6%.

This makes it a **robust and interpretable estimator** for real estate properties in the Indianapolis metropolitan area.

## 6. Conclusion

The **Indy House Price Predictor** combines an advanced machine learning model with a simple and accessible web interface.

It demonstrates how **data science, geolocation, and API deployment** can be integrated to deliver **real-time, localized price predictions**.

It is not just a technical demonstration — it is a **practical decision-support tool**.

It enables **real estate professionals** to obtain a quick and consistent first valuation of a property,  
and allows **homeowners or buyers** to easily understand the market value of a house.

Reliable, transparent, and accessible, it highlights the real-world potential of data science applied to real estate.
